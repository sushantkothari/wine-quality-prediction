# Wine-Quality-Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the quality of wine based on various chemical properties.

## Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to predict the quality of wine using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project contains information about several chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol content, which are used to predict the quality score of the wine on a scale.

## More About the Project

This project explores the application of multiple machine learning models to predict the quality of wine, with classes ranging from low to high quality. The models are evaluated based on several performance metrics to identify the most effective approach for this prediction task.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd wine-quality-prediction
    ```

## Usage

To run the prediction models, execute the Jupyter notebook:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train and evaluate the models.

## Workflow

The workflow of the Wine Quality Prediction project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: The wine quality dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: The dataset is explored to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between features. Visualization techniques such as correlation matrices and histograms are used to gain insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed to handle any missing values, normalize features, and split into training and testing sets.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Features are selected and transformed to improve model performance.
5. **Model Selection and Training**: Various machine learning models are selected and trained on the training data. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are performed to optimize the models.
6. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Model Comparison**: The performance of different models is compared to identify the best-performing models.
8. **Results Visualization**: The results are visualized to provide a clear understanding of model performance.
9. **Documentation and Reporting**: The entire process, findings, and results are documented in a Jupyter notebook and a README file.

## Concept

The concept behind the Wine Quality Prediction project is to leverage multiple machine learning models to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties. By comparing different models, the project aims to identify the best approach for this prediction task, following a systematic workflow of data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Regression and Classification**: The project explores both regression and classification models to predict continuous quality scores and classify wines into quality categories.
2. **Feature Engineering**: The process of selecting and transforming features to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The use of various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The process of optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
5. **Visualization**: The use of visualization techniques to explore data, understand model performance, and present results.

## Models

The following models are implemented in this project:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- F1-Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values, used for regression models.
